A simple TCP port scanner.

It will perform the following actions:

It asks what particular IP you want to see and will scan the parts that can range from 1-1000. It will notify if the port is open or closed.

If the port recieves no response it will state that port is possibly closed or maybe behind a firewall.

It will also print how many ports are open, closed, or recieved no response.

Goal:

To find any ports that are open that could lead to potential threats.
